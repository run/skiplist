## Skiplist written in C language.

**What's skiplist ?**

A skip list is a data structure for storing a sorted list of 
items using a hierarchy of linked lists that connect increasingly
sparse subsequences of the items. These auxiliary lists allow item 
lookup with efficiency comparable to balanced binary search trees 
(that is, with number of probes proportional to log n instead of n)
